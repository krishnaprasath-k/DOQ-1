# VAPI Voice AI Setup Instructions

## Current Status
Your VAPI integration is already implemented! You just need to add your VAPI credentials to make it work.

## What You Need

1. **VAPI Public Key** - Get this from your VAPI dashboard
2. **VAPI Assistant ID** - This should be the ID of your public AI assistant (currently set to: `8d1e9de3-cc4c-46ae-b38a-6f29ba8bd071`)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your VAPI Public Key
1. Go to [VAPI Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai)
2. Navigate to your account settings or API keys section
3. Copy your **Public Key** (not the private key)

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Add your VAPI public key to the `.env` file:

```env
# VAPI Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY=your_vapi_public_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID=8d1e9de3-cc4c-46ae-b38a-6f29ba8bd071
```

### 3. Verify Your Assistant ID
Make sure the assistant ID `8d1e9de3-cc4c-46ae-b38a-6f29ba8bd071` is correct:
1. Go to your VAPI dashboard
2. Check your assistants list
3. Copy the correct assistant ID if different

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Start Consultation"** → Opens dialog to select doctor and add notes
2. **User clicks "Start Consultation" in dialog** → Creates session and redirects to voice agent page
3. **User clicks "Start Call"** → Connects to your VAPI voice assistant
4. **Voice conversation happens** → Real-time transcription and AI responses
5. **User clicks "Disconnect"** → Ends call and generates medical report

## Testing

1. Make sure your environment variables are set
2. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Go to dashboard and click "Start a Consultation"
4. Fill in some symptoms and select a doctor
5. Click "Start Consultation" 
6. On the voice agent page, click "Start Call"
7. You should hear your VAPI assistant speaking!

## Troubleshooting

- **"VAPI public key not configured"** → Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY` to `.env`
- **"VAPI assistant ID not configured"** → Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` to `.env`
- **No voice/audio** → Check browser permissions for microphone access
- **Assistant doesn't respond** → Verify your assistant ID is correct in VAPI dashboard
